# odin-recipes
Our first full basic website build
we are going to be writing basic html code to buold a recipe website with hyperlinks and images
demonstrating our understanding off the previous lessons on building a webpage and ability to keep our work space clean
Accomplishing this will be our first time succesfully completing a portion of a coding class and understanding what we are doing
